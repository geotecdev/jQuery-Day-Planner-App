jQuery-Day-Planner-App
Web app that allows users to save notes to an interactive ui, built with jQuery

Application Description
This web app runs a quiz on a timer. The quiz asks users a series of 6 JavaScript related questions and saves a score to local storeage based on time remaining (if all the questions are answered). incorrect answers decrement the countdown timer by 7 seconds. the app also prompts users to enter a 'player name' value--also saved to local storage--so that thier scores can be displayed in a high scores table (highScores).

Application Notes
The app's logic is implimented in 'vanilla' javascript. I used globalally scoped variables in most instances and wrapped the statements that set element variables and event liteners with 'window.onload' to prevent execution before the elements in quetsion load before those statements are executed. The help modal is a bootstrap component, but the 'results' modal that shows at the end of the quiz is custom.

Extra Features
-Responsive bootstrap layout -if player name is not in local storage when user clicks the 'start quiz' button, they will be prompted to enter it -player name can be changed by clicking on the 'player: ' caption in the control bar header -high scores are persisted in localstorage. Table display sorts them by descending score with a custom comparer
